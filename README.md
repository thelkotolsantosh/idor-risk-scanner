# IDOR Risk Scanner
This project analyzes API access logs to identify patterns that may indicate
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) risks.

Instead of exploiting endpoints, it focuses on detection through behavioral
analysis of object ID access patterns.

## Common Indicators
- Sequential object ID access
- Cross-user object access
- High-velocity ID enumeration

## Intended Use
- Bug bounty methodology understanding
- Secure API design reviews
- Blue-team and AppSec labs
